These stars, bound together by gravity, have been forming for billions of years, and their combined light cuts through the darkness of space. Such clusters often serve as birthplaces for new stars, where gravity pulls gas and dust together into new solar systems.",

The galaxy's core, a glowing mass of older stars, anchors the structure, while the spiral arms are filled with younger, hotter stars. This galactic dance has been happening for billions of years, with each rotation revealing the universe's grandeur.",

These remnants from the formation of the star system may one day collide to form new planets, moons, or be cast out into the dark abyss of interstellar space. Each asteroid tells the story of the chaotic early days of solar system formation.",
